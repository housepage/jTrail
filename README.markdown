What is jTrail?
---------------

jTrail is a specialized breadcrumb specifically intended to display your progress from a beginning, "trailhead", through a specific series of pages, "landmarks", to a goal, "peak". It does this by accessing the states in the HTML5 History/State APIs using [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/history.js).

Requirements

* [History.js](https://github.com/balupton/history.js)
